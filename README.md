# How to apply this layer

** Adding the meta-openbmc-nuvoton-addon layer to your build. **

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-openbmc-nuvoton-addon layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-openbmc-nuvoton-addon layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:
```
BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-meta-openbmc-nuvoton-addon \
    "
```

**How to use**

1. Prepare a Poleg EVB with up-to-date boot block, Uboot and OpenBMC versions with this SOL patch applied.  Check with Nuvoton support for the most recent versions.

2. Prepare a Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 motherboard and a LPC cable.
    > _The UEFI firmware version in Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 for verification is 2.15.1234._

3. Connect pins of the **JTPM** header on **Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0** to the **J10** header on **Poleg EVB** with the LPC cable:
    * Connect **pin 1-3, 5, 7-8, 10-12, 15-17** of JTPM with corresponding pins of J10, **one on one**.
  
4. Steps to copy UEFI SOL related drivers to a USB drive.  

    * Format the USB drive in FAT or FAT32.  
    * Download PolegSerialDxe.efi and TerminalDxe.efi from  [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary) and copy them to the USB drive.

5. Power up the Poleg EVB and steps to prepare a working terminal for Poleg:

    * Download and install the USB-to-UART driver from: [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) according to the host OS in your workstation.  
    * Connect a micro usb cable from your workstation to J2 header of Poleg EVB.  
    * Wait for the FTDI driver to be installed automatically. The COM port number is assigned automatically.  
    * Open a terminal (e.g., Tera Term version 4.87) and set the correct COM port number assigned by the FTDI driver (in previous step).  
    * The COM port should be configured as follows: **115200, 8 bit, 1 stop-bit, no parity, no flow control**.  
    * Press and release the **PWR-ON-RST (SW3)** button to issue a Power-On-reset.  It's expected to see messages output by Poleg on the terminal. Use the following login name/password to login into Poleg.
        * Login name: **root**  
        * Login password: **0penBmc**  

6. Steps to configure Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 UEFI setting for SOL:

    * Do not plug any bootable device into Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * Power up Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and boot into UEFI setting.

### Time
  * **SNTP**  
  	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
    
    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of this file indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).

    * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
    **How to use**  
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/f38b505/openbmc/ntp.png">
    * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`  
      ->`Date and time settings`
    * Enable NTP by command  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 

      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
	
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_

    * Poleg connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  

      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on Poleg as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```

      **BMC time** is used by journal event log record, and **Host time** is used by Host do IPMI Set SEL Time command to sync BMC time from Host mechanism in an era of BMC without any network interface.  
      Currently, we cannot set Host time no matter what we use **busctl**, **REST API** or **ipmitool set time set** command. Due to **phosphor-settingd** this daemon set default TimeOwner is BMC and TimeSyncMethod is NTP. Thus, when TimeOwner is BMC that is not allow to set Host time anyway.

      A summary of which cases the time can be set on BMC or HOST

	  Mode      | Owner | Set BMC Time  | Set Host Time
	  --------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------
	  NTP       | BMC   | Fail to set   | Not allowed (Default setting)
	  NTP       | HOST  | Not allowed   | Not allowed
	  NTP       | SPLIT | Fail to set   | OK
	  NTP       | BOTH  | Fail to set   | Not allowed
	  MANUAL    | BMC   | OK            | Not allowed
	  MANUAL    | HOST  | Not allowed   | OK
	  MANUAL    | SPLIT | OK            | OK
	  MANUAL    | BOTH  | OK            | OK

      If user would like to set Host time that need to set Owner to SPLIT in NTP mode or set Owner to HOST/SPLIT/BOTH in MANUAL mode. However, change Host time will not effect BMC time and journal event log timestamp.

	**Set Time Owner to Split**
	```
	### With busctl on BMC
    busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Settings \
       /xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner \
       TimeOwner s xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split

	### With REST API on remote host
	curl -c cjar -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X  PUT  -d \
       '{"data": "xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split" }' \
       https://${BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner/attr/TimeOwner
	```
	**TimeZone**  
    According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on Poleg
    ```
    timedatectl list-timezones

### SOL IPMI
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e8178eef/openbmc/sol-ipmi.png">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the server’s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) is used as an example.

This is a patch for enabling SOL via IPMI using [phosphor-net-ipmid
](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

### Message Bridging

BMC Message Bridging provides a mechanism for routing IPMI Messages between different media.

Please refer to [IPMI Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html) for details about Message Bridging.

  * KCS to IPMB
  <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/icons/522a8e05/kcs2ipmb.png">
  
The command "Send Message" is used to routing IPMI messages from KCS to IPMB via System Interface.

Later, the response to the bridged request is received by the BMC and routed into the Receive Message Queue and it is retrieved using a Get Message command.

The patch integrates the [kcsbridge](https://github.com/openbmc/kcsbridge), [ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid) and [ipmbbridge](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/ipmbbridge/+/11130/) projects.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

**How to use**

1. The user is expected to know how to follow the instructions in the section **Setting up your OpenBMC project** in [Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc) to build and program an OpenBMC image into Poleg EVBs.  
    * Prepare a PC (which is referred as a build machine here) for building and programming the OpenBMC image.  
      > _The user is also expected to have general knowledge of ACPI/UEFI and know how to update the DSDT table in linux and build/update a linux kernel/driver._  

2. Prepare two Nuvoton Poleg EVBs. One is named Poleg EVB A and the other is Poleg EVB B.

    * Connect **pin 3-4** of J4 on Poleg EVB A with corresponding pins of J4 on Poleg EVB B, **one on one**.  
    * Connect **pin 12** of J3 on Poleg EVB A with corresponding pin of J3 on Poleg EVB B, **one on one**.  
    * The connection needs a **1k** resistor and a **3.3v** supply from Poleg EVB A.  
      > _The component name of 3.3v supply is P4._

3. Follow instructions from step-1, step-2, step-3 and step-5 in [SOL](#sol) **How to use** section to set up your workstation, Poleg EVB A and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    > _Follow instructions from step-1 and step-5 in [SOL](#sol) **How to use** section to set up Poleg EVB B_.  

4. Install Ubuntu 14.04 64bit on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 for the verification and login as a normal user.  
    > _The user is required to own root privileges on Ubuntu._

5. Poleg EVB A is configured to have its own slave address **0x10**. Poleg EVB B is configured to have its own slave address **0x58**.

    > _Poleg EVB A treats Poleg EVB B as its attached device on SMBUS/I2C bus and vice versa._

      ```
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image -c cleansstate  
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
      ```

    * Follow the section **Programming the images** of [Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc) to program the updated image into Poleg EVB B.

8. Modify the system interface driver in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to communicate with Poleg EVB A.

    * Download the kernel source code of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and locate the system interface driver source code.  
    * Locate the code in the function **init_ipmi_si** of ipmi_si_intf.c.
      ```
      enum ipmi_addr_src type = SI_INVALID;
      ```

    * Add the code next to the sentence "enum ipmi_addr_src type = SI_INVALID".
      ```
      return -1;
      ```

    * Rebuild the system interface driver and replace ipmi_si.ko of Ubuntu 14.04 with the one just rebuilt on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      > _The original ipmi_si.ko is located at /lib/modules/\`$(uname -r)\`/kernel/drivvers/char/ipmi_

    * Undo the "return -1" modification in the function **init_ipmi_si** of ipmi_si_intf.c.  
      + Rebuild the system interface driver again and leave the regenerated ipmi_si.ko in the kernel source code ipmi directory for system interface driver.

    * Reboot Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

9. Update the DSDT table in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  

    * Study the section **How to build a custom DSDT into an initrd** of [overriding-dsdt](https://01.org/zh/linux-acpi/documentation/overriding-dsdt) and [initrd_table_override.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/acpi/initrd_table_override.txt) to override DSDT in the initrd image of Ubuntu 14.04 and rebuild the Ubuntu kernel on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.
    * In the DSDT table, update the OEMRevision field in DefinitionBlock.  
    * In the DSDT table, create two objects used for accessing Poleg EVB A KCS devices via 0x4E, 0x4F.  
      ```
      Name (IDTP, 0x0CA4)  
      Name (ICDP, 0x0CA5)  
      ```

    * Locate the code section like below.  
      ```
      Device (SPMI)
      {
          ...
          Name (_STR, Unicode ("IPMI_KCS"))  
          Name (_UID, Zero)
      ```
    * Add the codes below following the sentence "Name (_UID, Zero)".  
      ```
      OperationRegion (IPST, SystemIO, ICDP, One)
      Field (IPST, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
      {
          STAS,   8
      }
      ```

    * Locate the code section like below in the same SPMI code section just mentioned.  
      ```
      Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)
      ...
      If (LEqual (Local0, 0xFF))
      {
      ...
      ```

      Store (0x1,  ACTR)
      Store (0x0C, IOAH)
      Store (0xA4, IOAL)
      Store (0x0C, IOH2)
      Store (0xA5, IOL2)
      ```

    * Rebuild the modified DSDT table and regenerate the initrd image of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * Reboot Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to load the overriden DSDT.

10. (Optional)Create shell scripts in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

    * The scripts here are just for convenience and for reference.  
    * Download and build [ioport-1.2.tar.gz](https://people.redhat.com/rjones/ioport/files/ioport-1.2.tar.gz).  
      + Locate the generated **outb** executive.
    * Create a script named "kcs_switch.sh" for example to configure the access to the kcs device of Poleg EVB A from Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * The user needs to modify the path to the outb executive in the script (kcs_switch.sh) below.  
      ```
      #!/bin/sh
      outb 0x4e 0x07
      outb 0x4f 0x11

      outb 0x4e 0x30
      outb 0x4f 0x1

      outb 0x4e 0x60
      outb 0x4f 0x0C
      outb 0x4e 0x61
      outb 0x4f 0xA4
      outb 0x4e 0x62
      outb 0x4f 0x0C
      outb 0x4e 0x63
      outb 0x4f 0xA5
      ```

     * Create a script name "insert_ipmi_mod.sh" for example to use the regenerated KCS driver in the kernel source code ipmi directory metioned in step-8.  
     * The user needs to modify the path to the KCS driver in insert_ipmi_mod.sh below.  

       ```
       #!/bin/sh
       sudo insmod ./ipmi_devintf.ko
       sudo insmod ./ipmi_si.ko
       ```

    * Make sure that two scripts above are executable.

11. Install the ipmiutil in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

    * Download, extract, build and install [ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmiutil/files/ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz).  
    * Open a terminal window and navigate to the extracted folder of ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz.  
    * Input the following command in the terminal window.
      ```
      sudo ./scripts/ipmi_if.sh
      ```
    * This generates /var/lib/ipmiutil/ipmi_if.txt.  
    * Edit /var/lib/ipmiutil/ipmi_if.txt with the root privilege. 
    * The value for "Base Address:" is **0x0000000000000CA2 (I/O)** and modify it to **0x0000000000000CA4 (I/O)**.

12. Test message bridging.

    * Power up or reboot Poleg EVB A and Poleg EVB B. Make sure that login screens of Poleg EVBs are displayed on the terminal window (e.g. Tera Term) on your workstation.
    * Power up or reboot Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and login into Ubuntu 14.04 as a normal user.  
      + Open a terminal window and execute **kcs_switch.sh** and **insert_ipmi_mod.sh** created in step-10 with the root privilege.
      + If the scripts are not created, input the contents of **kcs_switch.sh** and **insert_ipmi_mod.sh** except the #!/bin/sh line manually.
      + The user can use the following command in a terminal window under Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to verify Poleg system interface.
        ```
        dmesg | grep -i "bmc"
        ```
      
      + The user can check the man_id. For example, the man_id is **0x000000** for this case.
    * Enter the following command in a terminal window as a normal user of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      ```
      sudo ipmiutil cmd 18 34 02 10 18 d8 20 0e 01 d1 -x -s -j -F kcs
      ```
      > _The example command in the data field of "Send Message" command is "Get Device ID"._

    * Enter the following command in a terminal window as a normal user of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      ```
      sudo ipmiutil cmd 18 33 -x -s -j -F kcs
      ```
      > _The response to "Get Device ID" command might be "respData[len=26]: 1c 33 00 02 1e c2 58 00 01 00 00 00 02 03 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 a0"._
